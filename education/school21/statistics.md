## Statistics

- Instructor: [Dr. John Wilkerson](https://physics.unc.edu/people/wilkerson-john-f/)

- Abstract: Analyzing data and evaluating physics results requires an understanding of statistics, uncertainty estimation, and fitting methods. This mini course intends to provide students with the basic concepts behind analysis methods and techniques likely to be encountered or needed in their research. The course will not attempt to treat any topic exhaustively, rather, the goal is to (a) enable students to follow up on, modify, or develop certain techniques of interest, and use them in an informed way, and (b) make them aware of possible limitations such that they can realistically interpret research results. Topics to be covered include: evaluating physics results, estimating uncertainties (distributions and probability theory), hypotheses tests, parameter estimation including maximum likelihood, analysis and fitting using Frequentist and Bayesian methods, and special considerations when analyzing low statistics data
