## Geant4 simulation demonstrated with examples

## Abstract
An eight-week online seminar on Geant4 that not only covers the basic ideas and usage of Geant4, but also demonstrates the whole simulation process, from modeling the detector geometry to statistical analysis of the Geant4 output data. The learning of basic ideas and usage of Geant4 will be self-paced, following a series of tutorial videos on YouTube. Participants who have a simulation task in hand can describe their projects and the instructor will pick 4 to 6 of them as examples to demonstrate the whole process in weekly bases. Existing modules from last summer's successful mini-course will be re-offered in addition to about twelve new module
