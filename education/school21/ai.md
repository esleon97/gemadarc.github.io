## Abstract
Nowadays, the Big Data revolution has enabled machine learning to play a key role in many different aspects of our life. From the recommendation algorithm on YouTube to the reinforcement learning based AlphaGo, the power and versatility of machine learning has never failed to impress us. The particle physics community has also been utilizing machine learning algorithms to boost the possibility of scientific breakthrough. Neutrino physics experiment is naturally compatible with ML algorithms because of the large dataset size and well-established MC simulation tools. The purpose of this course is to expose frontier machine learning research results to students with a background in particle physics. We will start from some of the most basic concepts and models in ML, and gradually evolve to some of the research frontiers, including computer vision, time series processing, and advanced learning algorithms. Although most ML algorithms have a solid mathematical foundation, this course will aim at the application part and avoid unnecessary mathematical derivation. Thus it gets its name - practical machine learning.
