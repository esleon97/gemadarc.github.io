## Machine learning

- Instructor:
  - [Dr. Aobo Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aobo-li-9a0b15a7/)
  - Lecture Time: Starting July 16th, Friday 10:00 am EST - 11:00am EST, recurring until 5 modules are covered
  - Office Hour: Friday 11:00 am EST - 12:00am EST, immediately after each lecture.
  - If this time does not work for you, the course video will be uploaded to Youtube/Bilibili before the end of the same day.
- Entry Survey
  - **If you are interested in attending this course, please fill out the [Entry Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5rs2Uj9mmOpv8B5PbDvaN9TUIHLIpwtTaEIEPTqBdjf0mHw/viewform?usp=sf_link) as soon as possible.**
  - This will help me to request GPU resources of the course.
- Zoom Link:
  - Link 1: https://unc.zoom.us/j/95172547113
  - Link 2: https://unc.zoom.us/u/adTT0Jw1uI
- GPU Access:
  - NERSC generously provided us 30 training accounts with GPU access for this course, which should be enough to cover everyone in this course. Please follow the procedure:
    - **If you have a NERSC account and have GPU access**: There's nothing you need to do
    - **If you have a NERSC account, but No GPU access**: Please go to this [website](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a715ed9edbe0ff00200f7d321f9619f5&sysparm_category=e15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f) to request for GPU access as soon as possible
      - For the question "Is this request for NESAP-affiliated work?" Select No
      - For the question about GPU work load, choose 1 GPU for 16 hours.
    - **If you do not have a NERSC account**: please log into this [website](https://iris.nersc.gov/train) to register for the training account. The training code will be sent separately. 
      - The training account should already have GPU access.
      - **NERSC only allow you to register for training account after the event actually start (July 16th, 2021), so please register after that time.**

## Abstract
Nowadays, the Big Data revolution has enabled machine learning to play a key role in many different aspects of our life. From the recommendation algorithm on YouTube to the reinforcement learning based AlphaGo, the power and versatility of machine learning has never failed to impress us. The particle physics community has also been utilizing machine learning algorithms to boost the possibility of scientific breakthrough. Neutrino physics experiment is naturally compatible with ML algorithms because of the large dataset size and well-established MC simulation tools. The purpose of this course is to expose frontier machine learning research results to students with a background in particle physics. We will start from some of the most basic concepts and models in ML, and gradually evolve to some of the research frontiers, including computer vision, time series processing, and advanced learning algorithms. Although most ML algorithms have a solid mathematical foundation, this course will aim at the application part and avoid unnecessary mathematical derivation. Thus it gets its name - practical machine learning.
