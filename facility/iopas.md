The TEXONO Collaboration is pursuing a research program on low-energy neutrino and dark matter physics at the Kuo-Sheng Neutrino Laboratory (KSNL) at a distance of 28 m from the 2.9 GW reactor core. The laboratory is equipped with an outer 50-ton shielding structure consisting of, from outside in, 2.5 cm thick plastic scintillator panels with photomultiplier tubes readout for cosmic-ray veto (CRV), 15 cm of lead, 5 cm of stainless steel support structures, 25 cm of boron-loaded polyethylene and 5 cm of oxygen-free high- conductivity copper. Controller room of KS laboratory and front plastic scintillator panels of CRV system are depicted in the picture.
